# BasicGymWebsite
First ever project created after learning web-dev basics. Lacks quite a few things but ok for a beginner project.

1. It is NOT responsive.
2. Just a basic web project. No CRUD invovled (only create data and push to database at a basic level).
3. Styling may be a bit off in a few cases
4. Uses MongoDB. Pushes data to 'Customer' collection in 'ProjectGymDatabase' database.

Technologies used:
1. HTML (Pug template engine) 
2. CSS 
3. A little bit of JavaScript for front-end wherever necessary
4. Node js and Express
5. MongoDB
